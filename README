This c# (.net) open source command line utility will automatically download subtitles for your movies, rename your movies using a customized format, create folders for your movies and download imdb covers and details. You just pass a folder path and a preferred language list and it searches for subtitles using your avi files. It uses opensubtitles for the search and it requires the .net 2 framework runtimes which you probably already have.



Useage:
AutomagicSubs.exe "Path?" Code Sequence? Params?

Folder Path: The path to the folder that has all your movies. AutomagicSubs? will search all subfolders of this path for movies.

Language Code Sequence: A sequence of two letter language codes according to your preference separated by coma. You can find the two letter codes here: http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php AutomagicSubs? will search subtitles of the first language code and if it doesn't find one it will continue to the next code.

Params:

/rename will rename all the movies for which AutomagicSubs has found a subtitle using the format found in AutomagicSubs.exe.config.

/newonly will only try to locate subtitles for movies without subtitles and ignore the ones that have subtitles already

/nfo will download data from imdb.com (like actors, directors etc) and save them to a .nfo file named like your movie

/covers will download the cover images imdb uses and save them to a .jpg file named like your movie

/folders will create a folder for each movie and move all files there. If /covers is used with this then a folder.jpg will also be created so that whenever you browser your output folder with explorer's thumbnail view, this cover will be displayed over the folder icon.

/move="Path?" will move all files and folders for movies with available subtitles to the given path. Useful if combined with /folders so you don't have both old and new folders in the same directory

Config:
Edit your AutomagicSubs.exe.config to alter the way AutomagicSubs renames your movie files with /rename or creates folders with /folders.

CDFormat is the format used for the current CD. %C is the CD number.

FileFormat? is the format used for renaming your movies. %M is movie, %C is the CD string after format and %Y is year

Example1: %M renames to Casablanca Example2: %M(%Y)%C renames to Casablanca(1942)-CD1.avi

FolderFormat? is the format used for the /folders parameter to get each folder's name.

Example1: %M%Y creates outputPath\Casablanca(1942) Example2: %Y\\%M creates outputPath\1942\Casablanca

Examples:
AutomagicSubs.exe "c:\my videos" gr,en

This will first try to locate a greek subtitle for every movie in c:\my videos (including subfolders) and if it doesn't find one it will try to find one in english. You can use more language codes if you'd like.

AutomagicSubs.exe "c:\my videos" gr,en /rename will also rename all movies where subtitle has been found with the format found in AutomagicSubs.exe.config. default: MovieName?(Year)-CD2.avi

AutomagicSubs.exe "c:\my videos" gr,en /newonly will only search for subtitles for movies that don't have a subtitle already.
